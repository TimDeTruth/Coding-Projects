# Parallax Effect
Cool trick to add some pizzaz. Works by making different layers of content or background move at different speeds when the webpage scrolls -> creating the optical illusion of three dimensional depth. 

Used on 
-	Apple, Firewatch 

We will use a library called react-spring

This shows how perspective can change the relative speed of objects as the viewpoint moves.
